Overview
========

These sample projects are intended to be used to familiarize oneself with the
IRC.NET library and its API. The code that they contain should illustrate the
standard methods of accomplishing a variety of common tasks involving the
library.

Samples
=======

 * `MarkovChainTextBox`
   
   An IRC bot that runs as a Markov text generator. It trains on messages
   received from multiple channels across multiple IRC networks and can generate
   random sentences from this.
 
 * `TwitterBot`
   
   An IRC bot that runs as a service for interacting with Twitter via its web
   API. It is capable of posting tweets sent to it for arbitrary users, as well
   as giving notifications whenever a new tweet by a 'followed' user is seen.
